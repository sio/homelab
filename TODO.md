# Ideas

- Add a setup script that places all the symlinks in their places,
  support multiple targets: common, desktop, server, etc.
    - Test bootstrap script in virtual machine
    - Write topic lists
    - Update/write documentation (README.md)

- How do I copy from tmux to system clipboard when mouse mode is enabled?
