# TODO: Enable optional support for systemd-networkd
#       - Split off /etc/network/interfaces tasks from main.yml to interfaces.yml
#       - Create new tasks in systemd.yml, see:
#         - https://wiki.debian.org/Bonding
#         - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd#Bridge_interface
#       - Conditionally include either interfaces.yml or systemd.yml into main.yml:
#         `import_tasks: {{ kvm_bridge_config_type }}.yml`
#       - Provide a sensible default value for kvm_bridge_config_type based on Debian version:
#         - buster: interfaces
#         - bullseye: systemd
#         - unknown: interfaces
