# Gerbera DLNA media server

DLNA servers considered:

- **Minidlna**: development stalled, Debian package was last touched in 2017
- **Rygel**: too new. Moves fast, breaks things - not ok to be stuck with the
  version from Debian Stable
- **Gerbera**: long history, development is rather active. Package for Debian
  Stable is pretty outdated yet fully functional. Even if the maintainer will
  not show up for the next Stable, there are unofficial packages from Debian
  Multimedia
