# Common configuration files for my Unix-like machines
Configuration files (dotfiles) and other common files shared between
my local and remote machines (mostly server-side stuff)

These files are meant to be placed into "$HOME/.common" directory on all of
my Unix-like machines. Some kind of schedule has to be set up on each machine
to fetch changes from origin repository on a regular basis.

Creating symbolic links from appropriate places enables all or
part of shared configuration.


## Directory structure
### cli-tools/
Configuration files for command line tools (bash, vim, etc)

### cron/
Simple repeated tasks to be scheduled with cron

### git/
Hook samples and other reusable files

### morebooks/
Application behind morebooks.ml
