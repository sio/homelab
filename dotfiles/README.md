# Dotfiles by Vitaly Potyarkin

All dotfiles are organized into topic directories.

By default dotfiles are targeting "$HOME" and recreate the directory structure
of the topic directory below. Some topics target other directories (system-wide
configuration), that information is defined in `$topicname/dotfiles.meta`

See [bootstrap.sh](./bootstrap.sh) for more information.
